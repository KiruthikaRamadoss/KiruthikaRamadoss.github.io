Hello, I'm Kiruthika Ramadoss | Based in Austin, TX

Iâ€™m a data and machine learning enthusiast currently pursuing my MS in Data Analytics & Information Systems at Texas State University (Current GPA: 4.0). I'm passionate about turning data into meaningful insights and building scalable, real-world solutions. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and Power BI, I enjoy applying analytics, automation, and machine learning to solve complex problems and drive decision-making.

Graduating Dec 2025 | Open to Fall 2025 Internship Opportunities in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, or Machine Learning

##  Projects I've Worked On:

###  Real-Time Network Anomaly Detection  
- Detected anomalies in network traffic using Isolation Forest and Random Forest with SMOTE for class balancing; the best model achieved 83% recall and 63% accuracy.
- Engineered features and applied PCA for dimensionality reduction to optimize performance; developed a scalable ML workflow for real-time security monitoring.
- Presented the project at TXST 1st Data and AI Day â€“ Student Poster Showcase (2025), highlighting its relevance in real-world cybersecurity use cases.

Tools & Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, SMOTE, PCA, Jupyter Notebook
