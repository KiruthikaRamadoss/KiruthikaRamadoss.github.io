Hello, I'm Kiruthika Ramadoss | Based in Austin, TX

Iâ€™m a data and machine learning enthusiast currently pursuing my MS in Data Analytics & Information Systems at Texas State University (Current GPA: 4.0). I'm passionate about turning data into meaningful insights and building scalable, real-world solutions. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and Power BI, I enjoy applying analytics, automation, and machine learning to solve complex problems and drive decision-making.

Graduating Dec 2025 | Open to Fall 2025 Internship Opportunities in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, or Machine Learning

##  Projects I've Worked On:

###  Sentiment Analysis of Twitter (X) Data  

ðŸ”— [View GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KiruthikaRamadoss/Twitter-X-Sentiment-Analysis)

A machine learning and text mining project that classifies tweet sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) using TF-IDF and supervised learning models.

**Key Contributions:**

- Preprocessed and vectorized ~45,000 tweets using TF-IDF.
- Built and compared Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers.
- Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize sentiment trends by age and time of tweet.
- Explored public sentiment patterns to support marketing and brand analysis.

Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, TF-IDF, Power BI, Jupyter Notebook


###  Real-Time Network Anomaly Detection  

ðŸ”— [View GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KiruthikaRamadoss/Real-Time-Network-Anomaly-Detection)

An end-to-end ML pipeline to detect anomalies in synthetic network traffic, simulating cybersecurity threat identification.

**Key Contributions:**

- Developed an anomaly detection model using Isolation Forest and Random Forest with SMOTE to address class imbalance.
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance model performance and reduce dimensionality.
- Achieved 83% recall and 63% accuracy in detecting anomalous traffic.
- Presented at TXST 1st Data and AI Day â€“ Student Poster Showcase (2025).

Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, SMOTE, PCA, Jupyter Notebook


###  Diabetes Prediction Using Health Indicators  
- Built classification models including Logistic Regression and Neural Network to predict diabetes risk; best model achieved 96% accuracy.
- Extracted insights from health indicators to support early diabetes detection
Handled data preprocessing and class imbalance with SMOTE, evaluated and visualized model performance

###  Home Loan Credit Scoring Model  
- Developed robust home loan credit scoring model incorporating diverse data sources
- Enhanced risk assessment accuracy by 85% and improved decision-making for loan approvals by 98.5%
